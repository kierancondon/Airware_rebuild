# Make an AirWare website in 5 minutes

### Create a Github account

This step is easy. Go to www.github.com and make an account if you don't already have one.

### Create a new repository by cloning AirWare

Log in to your new Github account and navigate to your repositories.

Click "New" and find at the top the button to "import a repository".

Type in the URL of the repository behind AirWare: www.github.com/kierancondon/airware. You must type this in the box indicated by "Your old repository's clone URL".

Give your new repository a name. This step is important because it forms part of your website URL.

Click "Begin import".

### Activate Github Pages

This step allows your repository to appear as a website.

Once the import is done loading, head over to your new repository and click Settings. Scroll down to the section labelled Github Pages and activate Github Pages functionality. You can choose to build your site from the Master branch. There is no need to choose a theme.

You now have a website!
